## e2e_test

This package contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for the LocalAI API. The tests are written using the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library.

### File structure:
- e2e_suite_test.go
- e2e_test.go
- tests/e2e-aio/e2e_suite_test.go
- tests/e2e-aio/e2e_test.go
- tests/e2e-aio/sample_data_test.go

### Environment variables:
- LOCALAI_IMAGE
- LOCALAI_IMAGE_TAG
- LOCALAI_MODELS_DIR
- LOCALAI_API_PORT
- LOCALAI_API_ENDPOINT
- LOCALAI_API_KEY

### Code summary:
The package defines a single test function, TestLocalAI, which registers a failure handler and runs the test suite. The tests rely on the LOCALAI_API environment variable to determine the URL of the LocalAI API.

The tests cover various functionalities of the LocalAI API, including text generation, function calls, JSON output, image generation, embeddings, vision-based tasks, text-to-audio and audio-to-text conversion, voice activity detection (VAD), and reranking.

The tests are organized into contexts and use the Ginkgo testing framework. The code includes a mechanism to wait for the API to be ready before running the tests. It also checks the output of the API to ensure that the GPU was used for GPU acceleration.

### Edge cases:
- The tests can be launched by running the `go test` command in the root directory of the project.

### Unclear places:
- The code mentions a "BUILD_TYPE" environment variable, but it's not clear how it's set or used.

### Dead code:
- None found.

### Relations between code entities:
- The `TestLocalAI` function in `e2e_suite_test.go` is responsible for running the test suite.
- The `BeforeSuite`, `AfterSuite`, and `AfterEach` functions in `e2e_test.go` are executed before, after, and after each test case, respectively.
- The `startDockerImage` function in `e2e_test.go` is responsible for starting the Docker container for the LocalAI image.
- The tests in `tests/e2e-aio/e2e_suite_test.go` and `tests/e2e-aio/e2e_test.go` cover various functionalities of the LocalAI API.
- The `sample_data_test.go` file contains sample data used in the tests.

### Possible improvements:
- Add more detailed documentation to the code.
- Improve the organization of the tests to make them easier to understand and maintain.
- Add more tests to cover additional functionalities of the LocalAI API.
