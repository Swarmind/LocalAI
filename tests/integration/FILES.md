Summary:  
The integration_test package contains a single test suite for the LocalAI component. The test suite is executed using the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library. The test suite is configured to output logs to the console using the zerolog logging library.  
  
The test suite is designed to test the LocalAI component in a local environment. It is executed by running the `go test` command in the integration_test package directory. The test suite will run all the tests defined in the package and report any failures.  
  
The test suite is a valuable tool for ensuring the quality and stability of the LocalAI component. By running the test suite regularly, developers can catch issues early and prevent them from impacting users.

### External Data and Input Sources:  
  
- The tests use embedded assets from the backend-assets directory.  
- The tests use a temporary directory to store the assets.  
  
### TODOs:  
  
- None found.  
  
### Summary of Major Code Parts:  
  
1. **Normalization Function:**  
   - The `normalize` function takes a 2D array of float32 values and normalizes each vector. This is used to ensure that the vectors have a length of 1, which is important for calculating cosine similarities.  
  
2. **Integration Tests:**  
   - The `Describe` block contains a series of tests that cover various aspects of the stores backend and internal APIs.  
   - The tests are designed to verify that the backend can set, get, delete, and find keys in the store.  
   - The tests also check that the backend can handle different types of keys, including vectors and strings.  
   - The tests use a temporary directory to store the assets and a context to manage the lifetime of the backend.  
   - The tests use the `Expect` function to assert that the expected results are obtained.  
  
3. **Test Setup:**  
   - The tests set up a temporary directory and extract the embedded assets into it.  
   - The tests then create a new model loader and start a backend server.  
   - The tests use a context to manage the lifetime of the backend server.  
  
4. **Test Teardown:**  
   - After each test, the temporary directory is cleaned up and the backend server is stopped.  
  
5. **Test Cases:**  
   - The tests cover a variety of scenarios, including setting and getting keys, deleting keys, finding similar keys, and verifying that the triangle inequality holds.  
   - The tests use a combination of unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the backend is working correctly.  
  
6. **Assertions:**  
   - The tests use the `Expect` function to assert that the expected results are obtained.  
   - The tests also use the `log` function to print debug messages.  
  
7. **Helper Functions:**  
   - The tests use a number of helper functions to simplify the testing process.  
   - These functions include functions to set and get keys, delete keys, and find similar keys.  
  
8. **Error Handling:**  
   - The tests include error handling to ensure that the backend is working correctly in all cases.  
   - The tests use the `Expect` function to assert that the expected errors are raised.  
  
9. **Performance Testing:**  
   - The tests include performance testing to ensure that the backend is performing well.  
   - The tests measure the time it takes to perform various operations, such as setting and getting keys.  
  
10. **Security Testing:**  
   - The tests include security testing to ensure that the backend is secure.  
   - The tests check for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.  
  
By covering these aspects, the integration tests provide a comprehensive evaluation of the stores backend and internal APIs, ensuring that they are functioning correctly and meeting the required standards.
