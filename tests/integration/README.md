### External Data and Input Sources:

- The tests use embedded assets from the backend-assets directory.
- The tests use a temporary directory to store the assets.

### Summary of Major Code Parts:

1. **Normalization Function:**
   - The `normalize` function takes a 2D array of float32 values and normalizes each vector. This is used to ensure that the vectors have a length of 1, which is important for calculating cosine similarities.

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - The `Describe` block contains a series of tests that cover various aspects of the stores backend and internal APIs.
   - The tests are designed to verify that the backend can set, get, delete, and find keys in the store.
   - The tests also check that the backend can handle different types of keys, including vectors and strings.
   - The tests use a temporary directory to store the assets and a context to manage the lifetime of the backend.
   - The tests use the `Expect` function to assert that the expected results are obtained.

3. **Test Setup:**
   - The tests set up a temporary directory and extract the embedded assets into it.
   - The tests then create a new model loader and start a backend server.
   - The tests use a context to manage the lifetime of the backend server.

4. **Test Teardown:**
   - After each test, the temporary directory is cleaned up and the backend server is stopped.

5. **Test Cases:**
   - The tests cover a variety of scenarios, including setting and getting keys, deleting keys, finding similar keys, and verifying that the triangle inequality holds.
   - The tests use a combination of unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the backend is working correctly.

6. **Assertions:**
   - The tests use the `Expect` function to assert that the expected results are obtained.
   - The tests also use the `log` function to print debug messages.

7. **Helper Functions:**
   - The tests use a number of helper functions to simplify the testing process.
   - These functions include functions to set and get keys, delete keys, and find similar keys.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - The tests include error handling to ensure that the backend is working correctly in all cases.
   - The tests use the `Expect` function to assert that the expected errors are raised.

9. **Performance Testing:**
   - The tests include performance testing to ensure that the backend is performing well.
   - The tests measure the time it takes to perform various operations, such as setting and getting keys.

10. **Security Testing:**
   - The tests include security testing to ensure that the backend is secure.
   - The tests check for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

By covering these aspects, the integration tests provide a comprehensive evaluation of the stores backend and internal APIs, ensuring that they are functioning correctly and meeting the required standards.

### Project Package Structure:

- integration_suite_test.go
- stores_test.go
- tests/integration/integration_suite_test.go

### Relations between Code Entities:

The `integration_suite_test.go` file contains the main test suite, which is executed using the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library. The `stores_test.go` file contains the actual tests for the stores backend(s) and internal APIs. The tests in this file use the functions and data structures defined in the `integration_suite_test.go` file.
