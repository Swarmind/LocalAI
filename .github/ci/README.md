## Package: main

This package is the entry point for the LocalAI project, which provides a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API for running LLM, GPT, and genAI models locally. It handles setting up and running the application, including loading environment variables, parsing command-line interface (CLI) options, configuring logging, and populating the application with embedded backend assets.

### External Data and Input Sources:

- Environment variables loaded from .env files: .env, localai.env, ~/.config/localai.env, /etc/localai.env
- Command-line arguments provided by the user

### TODOs:

- None found.

### Summary of Major Code Parts:

1. **main function:** This function initializes the logging system, handles loading environment variables, parses CLI options, configures logging level, populates the application with embedded backend assets, and runs the application.
2. **logging system:** The code uses the zerolog package for logging, with a default level of INFO. The desired logging level can be set via CLI options or environment variables.
3. **environment variables:** The code loads environment variables from multiple .env files, including .env, localai.env, ~/.config/localai.env, and /etc/localai.env.
4. **CLI options:** The code uses the kong library to parse CLI options, which can be used to configure various aspects of the application, such as logging level, backend server address, and more.
5. **embedded backend assets:** The code populates the application with embedded backend assets, which are used by the various backend components to provide the necessary functionality.
6. **application execution:** Once the logging system, environment variables, and CLI options have been configured, the main function executes the application, which handles the actual processing of requests and interactions with the various backend components.

### Summary:

The code in this package is responsible for setting up and running the LocalAI application. It handles loading environment variables, parsing CLI options, configuring logging, and populating the application with embedded backend assets. The application itself is responsible for processing requests and interacting with the various backend components to provide the desired functionality.
