# Swagger

This package provides a simple web server that serves Swagger documentation.

```
swagger/
├── docs.go
├── swagger.json
└── swagger.yaml
```

The `swagger` package contains three files: `docs.go`, `swagger.json`, and `swagger.yaml`. The `docs.go` file is used to generate the Swagger documentation, while the `swagger.json` and `swagger.yaml` files contain the actual Swagger specification.

The `docs.go` file uses the `swag` tool to generate the Swagger documentation from the Go code. The `swag` tool is a command-line tool that can be used to generate Swagger documentation from Go code. To use the `swag` tool, you need to install it using the following command:

```
go get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag
```

Once the `swag` tool is installed, you can use it to generate the Swagger documentation by running the following command:

```
swag init
```

This will generate the `docs.go` file, which contains the Swagger documentation.

The `swagger.json` and `swagger.yaml` files contain the actual Swagger specification. The Swagger specification is a JSON or YAML file that describes the REST API. The Swagger specification includes information about the endpoints, parameters, and responses of the API.

The `swagger` package can be used to serve the Swagger documentation to clients. To do this, you need to create a web server that serves the `swagger.json` or `swagger.yaml` file. For example, you could use the following code to create a web server that serves the `swagger.json` file:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		http.ServeFile(w, r, "swagger.json")
	})

	fmt.Printf("Starting server at port 8080\n")
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

This code will create a web server that listens on port 8080 and serves the `swagger.json` file to clients.

The `swagger` package can be used to generate and serve Swagger documentation for your Go REST API. This documentation can be used by clients to understand and interact with your API.
