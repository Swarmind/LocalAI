This package contains test suites for the LocalAI startup process.

## Files

- pkg/startup/model_preload_test.go
- pkg/startup/startup_suite_test.go

## Code Summary

The `startup_test` package contains two test suites: `model_preload_test` and `startup_suite_test`.

The `model_preload_test` suite tests the Preload functionality, covering two scenarios: loading from embedded full-urls and downloading from URLs. In the first scenario, the test checks if the content of the downloaded file contains a specific substring. In the second scenario, the test verifies that the downloaded file exists.

The `startup_suite_test` suite contains a single function, `TestStartup`, which is responsible for running the Ginkgo test suite for the LocalAI startup process. The function registers a custom fail handler and executes the test suite, providing a comprehensive test environment for the LocalAI startup process.

Both test suites use the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library.
