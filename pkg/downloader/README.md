## Code Summary

1. **URI struct:** This struct represents a URL and provides methods for downloading files, checking if the URL looks like a specific type (e.g., OCI, Ollama), and resolving the URL to its full form.
2. **DownloadWithCallback and DownloadWithAuthorizationAndCallback methods:** These methods download a file from a given URL and execute a callback function with the downloaded data.
3. **FilenameFromUrl method:** This method extracts the filename from a given URL.
4. **LooksLikeURL and LooksLikeOCI methods:** These methods check if a given URL looks like a specific type (e.g., OCI, Ollama).
5. **ResolveURL method:** This method resolves a given URL to its full form.
6. **removePartialFile and calculateHashForPartialFile methods:** These methods handle partial downloads and calculate the hash of the downloaded data.
7. **checkSeverSupportsRangeHeader method:** This method checks if the server supports the Range header for partial downloads.
8. **DownloadFile method:** This method downloads a file from a given URL, handles partial downloads, and verifies the SHA hash of the downloaded file.
9. **formatBytes and calculateSHA methods:** These methods format the size of a file and calculate the SHA hash of a given file.

The package provides a comprehensive set of tools for downloading files from various sources, handling partial downloads, and verifying the integrity of the downloaded data.
