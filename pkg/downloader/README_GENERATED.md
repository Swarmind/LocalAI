This package contains tests for the downloader package. It covers various scenarios, including parsing GitHub URLs with and without branches, as well as handling URLs directly. The tests also cover the DownloadFile function, which handles downloading files from a mock server, including scenarios where the server supports or doesn't support range headers. The tests cover cases where the download needs to be resumed from a partially downloaded file, as well as cases where the download needs to be restarted from the beginning.

The code includes a custom RangeHeaderError type to handle errors related to invalid or ill-formatted range headers. The tests use a mock server to simulate a remote server and test the download functionality. The code includes functions to extract range headers from HTTP requests and to create a mock server for testing purposes. The tests cover various edge cases, such as when the server doesn't support range headers or when the range header is invalid. The code includes cleanup functions to remove temporary files created during testing.
