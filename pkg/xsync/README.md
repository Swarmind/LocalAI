# xsync_test

This package contains unit tests for the SyncMap data structure.

## File structure:

- pkg/xsync/map_test.go
- pkg/xsync/sync_suite_test.go

## Code summary:

The `map_test.go` file contains unit tests for the SyncMap data structure. The tests cover the following functionalities:
1. Setting and getting values in the SyncMap.
2. Deleting values from the SyncMap.
3. Checking if a key exists in the SyncMap.

The `sync_suite_test.go` file contains a single test function, TestSync, which is responsible for running the Ginkgo test suite for the LocalAI sync functionality. The test suite is registered with a custom fail handler and executed when the test function is called.

## Relations between code entities:

The `map_test.go` file imports the `SyncMap` data structure from the `github.com/mudler/LocalAI/pkg/xsync` package. The `sync_suite_test.go` file imports the `map_test.go` file and uses the `SyncMap` data structure in its tests.

## Edge cases:

The tests in this package cover a wide range of edge cases, including setting and getting values with different data types, deleting values, and checking if a key exists in the SyncMap.

## Unclear places:

None.

## Dead code:

None.
