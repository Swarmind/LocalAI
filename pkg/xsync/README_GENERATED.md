### SyncedMap

This code defines a `SyncedMap` struct, which is a thread-safe wrapper around a standard Go map. It uses a `sync.RWMutex` to protect the underlying map from concurrent access.

The `SyncedMap` struct has the following methods:

- `NewSyncedMap()`: Creates a new `SyncedMap` instance.
- `Map()`: Returns the underlying map.
- `Get(key K)`: Returns the value associated with the given key.
- `Keys()`: Returns a slice containing all the keys in the map.
- `Values()`: Returns a slice containing all the values in the map.
- `Len()`: Returns the number of key-value pairs in the map.
- `Iterate(f func(key K, value V) bool)`: Iterates over the map, calling the given function for each key-value pair.
- `Set(key K, value V)`: Sets the value associated with the given key.
- `Delete(key K)`: Deletes the key-value pair associated with the given key.
- `Exists(key K)`: Checks if a key exists in the map.

This `SyncedMap` implementation provides a convenient way to use a map in a concurrent environment without worrying about data races or other synchronization issues.

### File structure:
- map.go
- map_test.go
- sync_suite_test.go
- pkg/xsync/map.go

### Relations between code entities:
The `SyncedMap` struct is defined in the `map.go` file and is used in the `map_test.go` and `sync_suite_test.go` files for testing purposes. The `pkg/xsync/map.go` file is a copy of the `map.go` file and is used to provide a separate package for the `SyncedMap` struct.

### Unclear places:
The purpose of the `pkg/xsync/map.go` file is unclear. It is a copy of the `map.go` file, but it is not clear why it is needed.

### Dead code:
None.
