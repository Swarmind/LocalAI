# concurrency

This package provides a mechanism for handling asynchronous actions and their results. It introduces two main structures: JobResult and WritableJobResult.

JobResult is a read-only structure that stores the result of an asynchronous action. It contains the original request, the result, any potential errors, and a channel to signal when the result is ready. The Wait function allows waiting for the result to be ready or for the context to expire.

WritableJobResult is a structure that can update the JobResult. It provides the SetResult function to set the result and error of the associated JobResult.

The NewJobResult function creates a pair of JobResult and WritableJobResult, binding them to a given request.

This package enables developers to manage asynchronous operations and their results in a structured and thread-safe manner.

## Code Entities and Relations

The package contains a single test suite for the concurrency package. The test suite is written using the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library. The test suite is designed to run a series of tests that verify the functionality of the concurrency package.

The test suite is defined in the TestConcurrency function. This function registers a fail handler and runs the test suite using the RunSpecs function. The test suite is designed to cover all aspects of the concurrency package, including the creation and management of goroutines, channels, and mutexes.

## Unclear Places

Is it correct and idiomatic to return *ResultType instead of ResultType in the Wait function?
