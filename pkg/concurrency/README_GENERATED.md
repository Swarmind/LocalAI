# concurrency_test

This package contains unit tests for the concurrency package.

## Project package structure:

- concurrency_suite_test.go
- jobresult.go
- jobresult_test.go
- pkg/concurrency/jobresult_test.go

## Code summary:

The package defines a suite of unit tests for the concurrency package. The tests cover three main scenarios: receiving a result, receiving an error, and handling timeouts. In each scenario, a JobResult object is created and used to communicate between goroutines. The tests verify that the JobResult object correctly handles the expected behavior in each scenario. The tests use the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library.

## Edge cases:

The package can be launched by running the following command:

```
go test -v ./pkg/concurrency
```
