# pkg/utils

This package provides various utility functions for working with strings, paths, and other data types.

## File structure:

- base64.go
- base64_test.go
- config.go
- ffmpeg.go
- hash.go
- json.go
- logging.go
- path.go
- strings.go
- untar.go
- utils_suite_test.go

## Code summary:

The package contains functions for working with base64 encoding, configuration files, FFmpeg, hashing, JSON, logging, paths, strings, and untarring files.

The `base64.go` file provides functions for encoding and decoding strings using base64. The `config.go` file contains functions for loading and parsing configuration files. The `ffmpeg.go` file provides functions for interacting with the FFmpeg multimedia framework. The `hash.go` file contains functions for generating hashes of strings and files. The `json.go` file provides functions for encoding and decoding JSON data. The `logging.go` file contains functions for logging messages to various destinations. The `path.go` file provides functions for working with file paths. The `strings.go` file contains functions for manipulating strings. The `untar.go` file provides functions for untarring files.

The `utils_suite_test.go` file contains a test suite for the entire package. It uses the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library to test the various functions in the package.

## Unclear places:

- The purpose of the `ffmpeg.go` file is not entirely clear, as it only contains a single function that returns a string. It's possible that this function is intended to be used in conjunction with other functions in the package, but this is not explicitly stated.

## Dead code:

- The `config.go` file contains a function called `LoadConfigFromEnv` that is not used anywhere in the package. This function is likely dead code and could be removed.

## Edge cases:

- The package does not appear to have any specific edge cases or error handling mechanisms.

## Possible improvements:

- The `ffmpeg.go` file could be improved by providing more detailed documentation on its purpose and usage.
- The `config.go` file could be improved by removing the unused `LoadConfigFromEnv` function.
- The package could be improved by adding more comprehensive error handling and edge case handling.
