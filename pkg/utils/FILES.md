External data, input sources:  
- The code uses the GetContentURIAsBase64 function from the utils package to process input strings.  
- It tests the function with various input strings, including data URLs and regular URLs.  
  
TODOs:  
- The test case "GetImageURLAsBase64 can actually download images and calculates something" mentions that it doesn't actually check the results, which is bad. This should be addressed.  
  
Summary:  
- The code defines a suite of tests for the GetContentURIAsBase64 function from the utils package.  
- The tests cover various scenarios, including stripping data URL prefixes, handling bogus data, and downloading images.  
- The tests use the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library.  
- The tests are designed to ensure that the GetContentURIAsBase64 function works as expected in different situations.
