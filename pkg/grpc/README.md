# grpc

This package provides a gRPC client and server for interacting with a LocalAI system. The client allows users to perform various operations, such as health checks, embeddings, predictions, loading models, and more. The server exposes the LLM functionalities that are called by the client.

## File Structure

- backend.go
- base/base.go
- base/singlethread.go
- client.go
- embed.go
- interface.go
- server.go

## Code Summary

The package defines a Backend interface that provides various functionalities related to embeddings, predictions, model loading, and other tasks. It also includes functions to provide and build clients for the backend.

The Provide function registers a backend with a given address and LLM. The NewClient function returns a Backend instance based on the provided address, parallel flag, WatchDog, and enableWatchDog flag. The buildClient function creates a Client instance with the given address, parallel flag, and WatchDog.

The Client struct implements the Backend interface and provides methods for interacting with the gRPC server. The code also includes functions for health checks, embeddings, predictions, model loading, and other tasks.

The server is implemented as a gRPC service, with the following methods:
- Health: Checks the health of the server.
- Embedding: Runs the inference with options and returns the embeddings.
- LoadModel: Loads the specified model.
- Predict: Runs the inference with options.
- GenerateImage: Generates an image based on the input.
- TTS: Generates audio based on the input text.
- SoundGeneration: Generates audio based on the input sound.
- AudioTranscription: Transcribes the input audio.
- PredictStream: Runs the inference with options and streams the results.
- TokenizeString: Tokenizes the input string.
- Status: Returns the status of the LLM model.
- StoresSet: Sets a key-value pair in the LLM's storage.
- StoresDelete: Deletes a key-value pair from the LLM's storage.
- StoresGet: Retrieves a value from the LLM's storage.
- StoresFind: Finds a value in the LLM's storage.
- VAD: Performs Voice Activity Detection.

## External Data and Input Sources

The code interacts with a gRPC server, which is an external data source. It also uses a WatchDog, which is an external input source.

## TODOs

There are no TODO comments in the code.

## Summary

The grpc package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with a gRPC backend, enabling users to perform various operations and manage resources effectively. The client and server components work together to facilitate communication and data exchange between the LocalAI system and its clients.
