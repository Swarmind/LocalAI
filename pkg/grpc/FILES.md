### Summary:  
  
The package defines a `Client` struct that handles communication with a gRPC backend. The client provides methods for various operations, such as health checks, embeddings, predictions, loading models, and more.  
  
1. **Client Struct:**  
   - The `Client` struct represents a client for interacting with the gRPC backend. It stores the address of the backend, a flag indicating whether the client is busy, a flag indicating whether parallel operations are allowed, and a mutex for synchronization.  
   - The struct also implements the `WatchDog` interface, which allows it to mark and unmark the backend address for monitoring purposes.  
  
2. **Health Check:**  
   - The `HealthCheck` method checks the health of the backend by sending a health request and waiting for a response. If the response indicates that the backend is healthy, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false and an error message.  
  
3. **Embeddings, Predictions, and Model Loading:**  
   - The `Embeddings`, `Predict`, `LoadModel`, and `PredictStream` methods allow the client to perform various operations on the backend, such as generating embeddings, making predictions, loading models, and streaming predictions. These methods handle synchronization and resource management to ensure proper operation.  
  
4. **Other Operations:**  
   - The client also provides methods for generating images, performing text-to-speech synthesis, sound generation, audio transcription, tokenization, retrieving status information, managing stores, reranking results, obtaining token metrics, and voice activity detection.  
  
5. **WatchDog Interface:**  
   - The `WatchDog` interface is used by the client to mark and unmark the backend address for monitoring purposes. This allows the client to keep track of the backend's status and take appropriate actions if necessary.  
  
In summary, the package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with a gRPC backend, enabling users to perform various operations and manage resources effectively.
