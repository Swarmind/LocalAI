# pkg/grpc/base

This package provides base functionality for backends to implement.

## pkg/grpc/base/base.go
This file defines the Base struct, which is a base class for all backends to implement. It provides default implementations for all the methods required by the GRPC service interface.

The memoryUsage function calculates the memory usage of the backend process and returns a MemoryUsageData object.

The Status method returns the memory usage of the backend process.

The other methods are not implemented and return an error.

## pkg/grpc/base/singlethread.go
This file defines the SingleThread struct, which represents a backend that does not support multiple requests. This struct inherits from the Base struct and implements the Locking(), Lock(), Unlock(), and Busy() methods.

The Locking() method returns true, indicating that the backend needs to lock resources. The Lock() and Unlock() methods are used to acquire and release the lock, respectively. The Busy() method checks if the backend is currently busy by attempting to acquire the lock. If the lock is acquired, it is immediately released, and the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The SingleThread struct also implements the Status() method, which returns a StatusResponse object containing information about the backend's state and memory usage. The state is determined by checking if the backend is busy using the Busy() method. The memory usage is obtained by calling the memoryUsage() function.

The SingleThread struct is designed for models that are not thread-safe and cannot run multiple requests concurrently. It ensures that only one request is being served at a time by using a mutex to protect shared resources.

## Relations between code entities
The SingleThread struct inherits from the Base struct, which is defined in the base.go file. Both structs are part of the same package, pkg/grpc/base.

## Unclear places
The memoryUsage() function is not provided in the given code snippet. It's assumed that this function is defined elsewhere and provides information about memory usage.

## Dead code
There is no dead code in the provided code snippets.
