# store

This package provides a set of functions for interacting with a key-value store through a GRPC client. It allows users to set, delete, and retrieve key-value pairs from the store. The store supports columnar format for setting and deleting multiple key-value pairs. The package also includes a function for finding similar keys to a given key.

## File structure:

- client.go
- pkg/store/client.go

## Code summary:

The package provides the following functions:

- SetCols: Sets multiple key-value pairs in the store.
- SetSingle: Sets a single key-value pair in the store.
- DeleteCols: Deletes multiple key-value pairs from the store.
- DeleteSingle: Deletes a single key-value pair from the store.
- GetCols: Gets multiple key-value pairs from the store.
- GetSingle: Gets a single key-value pair from the store.
- Find: Finds similar keys to a given key.

The functions handle the conversion between the Go data structures and the proto messages used for communication with the GRPC server.

## Relations between code entities:

The functions in this package interact with a GRPC server to store and retrieve data. The package is designed to simplify the use of the key-value store for common use cases.

## Edge cases:

The package does not explicitly handle any edge cases. However, it relies on the underlying GRPC client to handle any potential errors or issues during communication with the server.

## Unclear places:

The package does not provide any documentation or comments explaining the specific use cases or scenarios where each function would be most appropriate.

## Dead code:

There is no apparent dead code in the package.

## Configuration:

The package does not have any configuration options.

## Environment variables:

The package does not use any environment variables.

## Flags:

The package does not use any flags.

## Command-line arguments:

The package does not use any command-line arguments.

## Files and their paths:

The package does not use any files for configuration.

## Conclusion:

The package provides a simple and efficient way to interact with a key-value store through a GRPC client. It offers a set of functions for setting, deleting, and retrieving key-value pairs, as well as finding similar keys. The package is designed to simplify the use of the key-value store for common use cases.
