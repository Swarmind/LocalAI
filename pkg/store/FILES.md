Summary:  
- The package provides a set of functions for interacting with a key-value store through a GRPC client.  
- The functions allow users to set, delete, and retrieve key-value pairs from the store.  
- The store supports columnar format for setting and deleting multiple key-value pairs.  
- The package also includes a function for finding similar keys to a given key.  
- The functions handle the conversion between the Go data structures and the proto messages used for communication with the GRPC server.  
- The package is designed to simplify the use of the key-value store for common use cases.  
  
- SetCols: Sets multiple key-value pairs in the store.  
- SetSingle: Sets a single key-value pair in the store.  
- DeleteCols: Deletes multiple key-value pairs from the store.  
- DeleteSingle: Deletes a single key-value pair from the store.  
- GetCols: Gets multiple key-value pairs from the store.  
- GetSingle: Gets a single key-value pair from the store.  
- Find: Finds similar keys to a given key.  
- The package provides a simple and efficient way to interact with a key-value store through a GRPC client.
