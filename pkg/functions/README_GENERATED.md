## LocalAI Functions Package

This package provides functionality for parsing and working with functions in the context of the LocalAI project. It includes functions for converting functions to JSON structures, selecting specific functions from a list, and parsing function calls from various input formats.

### Package Structure

The package consists of the following files:

- `function_structure.go`: Defines the structure for representing functions.
- `functions.go`: Contains the core functions for working with functions, such as converting them to JSON and selecting specific functions.
- `functions_suite_test.go`: Provides a test suite for the functions package.
- `functions_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the functions package.
- `grammars/bnf_rules.go`: Defines the BNF rules for the grammars used in the package.
- `grammars/grammars_suite_test.go`: Provides a test suite for the grammars package.
- `grammars/json_schema.go`: Defines the JSON schema for the grammars used in the package.
- `grammars/json_schema_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the grammars package.
- `grammars/llama31_schema.go`: Defines the schema for the Llama 31 grammar.
- `grammars/llama31_schema_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the Llama 31 grammar.
- `grammars/options.go`: Defines the options for the grammars used in the package.
- `grammars/rules.go`: Defines the rules for the grammars used in the package.
- `grammars/types.go`: Defines the types for the grammars used in the package.
- `json_mode.go`: Provides functions for working with JSON mode.
- `parse.go`: Contains functions for parsing function calls from various input formats.
- `parse_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the parse package.

### Functionality

The package provides the following key functionalities:

1. **Function Parsing:** The `parse` package offers functions for parsing function calls from various input formats, such as JSON strings, regex patterns, and more. This allows the package to handle a wide range of function call representations.

2. **JSON Conversion:** The `functions` package includes functions for converting a list of functions to a JSON structure and vice versa. This enables easy serialization and deserialization of function data.

3. **Function Selection:** The `functions` package provides a function for selecting a specific function from a list based on a given key. This allows users to easily access and work with individual functions.

4. **Grammar Support:** The `grammars` package defines the grammars used for parsing function calls and provides functions for working with these grammars. This ensures that the package can handle a variety of function call formats.

5. **Testing:** The package includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the correctness and reliability of its functionalities.

### Usage

The LocalAI functions package can be used in any application that requires parsing and working with functions. For example, it can be used in a chatbot to understand and respond to user requests, or in a data analysis tool to extract information from text.

### Conclusion

The LocalAI functions package provides a powerful and versatile set of tools for working with functions in various contexts. Its comprehensive functionality, combined with its thorough testing, makes it a valuable asset for any application that requires function parsing and manipulation.
