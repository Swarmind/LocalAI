# functions

This package provides functionality for parsing and processing the output of a language model, specifically focusing on handling function calls and grammar parsing.

## Package Structure

The package consists of the following files:

- `function_structure.go`
- `functions.go`
- `functions_suite_test.go`
- `functions_test.go`
- `grammars/bnf_rules.go`
- `grammars/grammars_suite_test.go`
- `grammars/json_schema.go`
- `grammars/json_schema_test.go`
- `grammars/llama31_schema.go`
- `grammars/llama31_schema_test.go`
- `grammars/options.go`
- `grammars/rules.go`
- `grammars/types.go`
- `json_mode.go`
- `parse.go`
- `parse_test.go`

## External Data and Input Sources

The package relies on the following external data and input sources:

1. A configuration file containing settings for grammar parsing, function call handling, and other related options.
2. The output of a language model, which is expected to be in a specific format depending on the configuration.

## TODOs

1. Improve the handling of responses where an object as a value is expected/required.

## Major Code Parts

1. **Grammar Configuration:** The `GrammarConfig` struct defines the settings for grammar parsing, including options for mixed mode, parallel calls, and more.

2. **Function Configuration:** The `FunctionsConfig` struct configures the handling of function calls, including options for extracting function names and arguments from the language model output.

3. **Grammar Options:** The `GrammarOptions` function generates a list of options for the grammar parser based on the provided configuration.

4. **LLM Result Cleanup:** The `CleanupLLMResult` function processes the language model output, replacing specific strings with predefined values.

5. **Text Content Parsing:** The `ParseTextContent` function extracts specific information from the language model output based on a set of capture rules.

6. **JSON Parsing:** The `ParseJSON` function parses a JSON string, handling potential syntax errors and multiple JSON objects within the string.

7. **Function Call Parsing:** The `ParseFunctionCall` function extracts function names and arguments from the language model output, using a combination of regular expressions and grammar parsing.

8. **Function Call Argument Parsing:** The `ParseFunctionCallArgs` function extracts function argument key-value pairs from the language model output, converting them into a valid JSON string.

In summary, this package provides a comprehensive set of tools for parsing and processing the output of a language model, enabling the extraction of function calls and their arguments, as well as handling grammar-related tasks.

## Relations between Code Entities

The package's components work together to parse and process the output of a language model. The `GrammarConfig` and `FunctionsConfig` structs define the settings for grammar parsing and function call handling, respectively. The `GrammarOptions` function generates a list of options for the grammar parser based on the provided configuration. The `CleanupLLMResult`, `ParseTextContent`, `ParseJSON`, `ParseFunctionCall`, and `ParseFunctionCallArgs` functions handle various aspects of parsing and processing the language model output.

## Unclear Places

The provided code does not mention how the grammar parsing and function call handling settings are loaded from the configuration file. It is unclear how the package interacts with the language model to obtain its output.

## Dead Code

There is no dead code in the provided code.
