Summary:  
This file contains unit tests for the functions package. It tests the ToJSONStructure() function, which converts a list of functions to a JSON structure, and the Select() function, which selects one of the functions and returns a list containing only the selected one. The tests cover various scenarios, including using custom keys and selecting functions from a list.  
  
### ToJSONStructure() function tests  
The ToJSONStructure() function is tested with different input parameters and custom keys. The tests verify that the function correctly converts the input data to a JSON structure and that the resulting structure can be parsed to a grammar.  
  
### Select() function tests  
The Select() function is tested by selecting a function from a list and verifying that the resulting list contains only the selected function.  
  
  
  
# pkg/functions/parse_test.go  
## Package: functions_test  
  
This package contains tests for the LocalAI function parsing functionality.  
  
### External Data and Input Sources  
  
The tests use a variety of input strings to test the parsing functionality. These strings are designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, including:  
  
* Valid JSON strings with various types and structures  
* Invalid JSON strings with syntax errors  
* Strings containing both valid and invalid JSON parts  
* Strings containing function calls with different grammars and regex patterns  
  
### TODOs  
  
There are no TODO comments in this code.
