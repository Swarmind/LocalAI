External data, input sources:  
- The code uses a test directory "/tmp/test_model_path" to store model files.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the code.  
  
Summary:  
- The code defines a suite of tests for the ModelLoader component.  
- The ModelLoader is responsible for loading and managing models.  
- The tests cover various aspects of the ModelLoader, including creating a new instance, checking if a model exists in the model path, listing all valid model files, loading a model, and shutting down a loaded model.  
- The tests use mock objects to simulate the behavior of the underlying model loading mechanism.  
- The tests verify that the ModelLoader functions correctly in different scenarios, such as when a model is successfully loaded, when a model fails to load, and when a model is shut down.
