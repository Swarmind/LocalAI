External data, input sources:  
- The code uses the HuggingFace API to interact with language models. It requires a token to authenticate with the API.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the code.  
  
Summary:  
- The HuggingFace struct represents a HuggingFace language model. It stores the model path and the authentication token.  
- The NewHuggingFace function creates a new HuggingFace instance, taking the repository ID and token as input. It returns an error if the token is not provided.  
- The PredictHuggingFace function takes the input text and prediction options as input. It initializes a HuggingFace client, converts the prediction options to the appropriate format, and calls the inference API to get the prediction. The function returns the prediction result and any errors encountered.

Summary:  
The code defines a PredictOptions struct, which is used to configure the behavior of a text generation model. It includes options for setting the model, maximum number of tokens, temperature, and stop words. The struct also includes a set of functions for setting these options, as well as a NewPredictOptions function for creating a new PredictOptions object with the given options.  
  
- PredictOptions struct: This struct holds the configuration options for the text generation model. It includes fields for the model name, maximum number of tokens, temperature, and stop words.  
- PredictOption type: This type is used to define functions that can be used to set the configuration options for the text generation model.  
- DefaultOptions variable: This variable holds the default configuration options for the text generation model.  
- SetModel, SetTemperature, SetMaxTokens, SetStopWords functions: These functions are used to set the configuration options for the text generation model.  
- NewPredictOptions function: This function creates a new PredictOptions object with the given options.
