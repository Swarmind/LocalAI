# langchain

This package provides tools for interacting with language models, specifically those hosted on HuggingFace. It includes functionality for creating and managing HuggingFace language models, as well as configuring and executing text generation tasks.

## File structure:

- huggingface.go
- langchain.go

## Code summary:

The `huggingface.go` file defines the `HuggingFace` struct, which represents a HuggingFace language model. It stores the model path and the authentication token. The `NewHuggingFace` function creates a new `HuggingFace` instance, taking the repository ID and token as input. It returns an error if the token is not provided. The `PredictHuggingFace` function takes the input text and prediction options as input. It initializes a HuggingFace client, converts the prediction options to the appropriate format, and calls the inference API to get the prediction. The function returns the prediction result and any errors encountered.

The `langchain.go` file defines the `PredictOptions` struct, which is used to configure the behavior of a text generation model. It includes options for setting the model, maximum number of tokens, temperature, and stop words. The struct also includes a set of functions for setting these options, as well as a `NewPredictOptions` function for creating a new `PredictOptions` object with the given options.

## Relations between code entities:

The `PredictOptions` struct is used by the `PredictHuggingFace` function to configure the behavior of the HuggingFace language model during text generation tasks.

## Unclear places:

The code does not explicitly mention how the HuggingFace client is initialized or how the inference API is called. It is assumed that these details are handled by the `huggingface` package.

## Dead code:

There is no apparent dead code in the provided files.
