# jina

This package implements a Jina reranker endpoint for the LocalAI project. It handles HTTP requests, reranks documents using a specified model, and returns the results.

The package relies on several external data sources and configurations:

- `schema.JINARerankRequest`: This object contains the query, model, topN, and documents to be reranked.
- `config.BackendConfigLoader`: Used to load the backend configuration.
- `model.ModelLoader`: Used to load the model.
- `config.ApplicationConfig`: Used to load the application configuration.

The core functionality of the package is encapsulated in the `JINARerankEndpoint` function. This function takes a `JINARerankRequest` object as input and uses the `backend.Rerank` function to rerank the documents. The results are then returned as a `JINARerankResponse` object.

The package also includes error handling to ensure that the function returns a `fiber.ErrBadRequest` error if the input is invalid or if the `backend.Rerank` function returns an error.

## Project package structure:

- rerank.go
- core/http/endpoints/jina/rerank.go

## Relations between code entities:

The `JINARerankEndpoint` function interacts with several other components:

- `backend.Rerank`: This function performs the actual reranking of the documents.
- `schema.JINARerankRequest` and `schema.JINARerankResponse`: These objects define the input and output formats for the `JINARerankEndpoint` function.
- `proto.RerankRequest`: This object is used to communicate with the gRPC server.
- `Fiber`: This web framework handles the HTTP request and response.
- `Zerolog`: This logging library is used for debugging.

## Unclear places:

- The code does not explicitly mention how the model is loaded or configured. It is assumed that the `model.ModelLoader` handles this process.
- The code does not mention how the backend configuration is used by the `backend.Rerank` function.

## Dead code:

- None detected.
