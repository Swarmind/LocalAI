Summary:
The `explorer_test` package contains a single function, `TestExplorer`, which is responsible for running the test suite for the `Explorer` component. It registers a fail handler and runs the specs for the test suite.

### Database Management

This section covers the tests for the Database object in the explorer package. The tests cover various aspects of database management, including adding, retrieving, and deleting tokens, as well as persisting data to disk.

- The first test case checks if a token can be added to the database and retrieved successfully.
- The second test case verifies that a token can be deleted from the database.
- The third test case tests the persistence of data to disk by recreating the database object and checking if the token is still present.

### Handling Empty or Non-Existent Files

This section covers the tests for handling empty or non-existent database files.

- The test case checks if the database starts with an empty state when a non-existent file path is provided.
- It also verifies that the database does not contain any tokens when the file is empty.
