# cliContext

This package provides a Context struct that stores configuration settings for the application. The Context struct includes fields for debug mode and log level, which can be set using environment variables. The BackendAssets field is used to store embedded assets, such as configuration files or templates.

## Files

- context.go
- core/cli/context/context.go

## Configuration

- Environment variables:
    - LOCALAI_DEBUG: If set to true, enables debug mode.
    - DEBUG: If set to true, enables debug mode.
    - LOCALAI_LOG_LEVEL: Sets the log level. Allowed values are error, warn, info, debug, and trace.

## Edge Cases

- If the LOCALAI_DEBUG or DEBUG environment variables are set to true, the Debug field will be set to true.
- If the LOCALAI_LOG_LEVEL environment variable is set, the LogLevel field will be set to the specified value.

## Relations

The Context struct is used to store and manage the application's configuration settings. It provides a centralized location for storing and accessing configuration data, making it easy to manage and update the application's settings.

## Unclear Places

- The BackendAssets field is an embed.FS object that stores embedded assets. It is not a command line argument/flag, and it is excluded from the parsed CLI. It is unclear how this field is populated or used.
