# LocalAI

This package is responsible for managing the backend configuration, model loading, and template evaluation.

## core/application/application.go
This file contains the `Application` struct, which is responsible for managing the backend configuration, model loading, and template evaluation. It includes the following components:
- `backendLoader`: Loads the backend configuration.
- `modelLoader`: Loads models.
- `applicationConfig`: Stores the application configuration.
- `templatesEvaluator`: Evaluates templates.

The `newApplication` function creates a new instance of the `Application` struct, initializing the required components with the provided application configuration. The `BackendLoader`, `ModelLoader`, `ApplicationConfig`, and `TemplatesEvaluator` functions provide access to the corresponding components of the `Application` struct.

## core/application/config_file_watcher.go
This file contains the `configFileHandler` struct, which is responsible for handling configuration file updates. It registers handlers for specific files and watches for changes in the configuration directory. The `Register` method allows registering a handler for a specific file. If `runNow` is set to true, the handler is called immediately. The `Watch` method starts watching the configuration directory for changes. If a change is detected, the corresponding handler is called. The `Stop` method closes the watcher and stops monitoring the configuration directory.

## core/application/startup.go
This file contains the `Application` struct, which is responsible for managing the backend configuration, model loading, and template evaluation. It includes the following components:
- `backendLoader`: Loads the backend configuration.
- `modelLoader`: Loads models.
- `applicationConfig`: Stores the application configuration.
- `templatesEvaluator`: Evaluates templates.

The `New` function initializes a new Application instance with the given configuration options. It sets up the backend, loads the models, and starts the configuration watcher. The `startWatcher` function starts a watcher to monitor the configuration directory for changes. The `newConfigFileHandler` function creates a new ConfigFileHandler instance. The `Watch` function starts the watcher and monitors the configuration directory for changes. The `Handle` function handles the configuration file changes. The `Stop` function stops the watcher.

## Project package structure
- application.go
- config_file_watcher.go
- startup.go
- core/application/application.go
- core/application/config_file_watcher.go
- core/application/startup.go

## Relations between code entities
The `Application` struct in `startup.go` uses the `configFileHandler` struct from `config_file_watcher.go` to monitor configuration file changes. The `configFileHandler` struct uses the `backendLoader`, `modelLoader`, and `applicationConfig` components from the `Application` struct in `application.go` to update the application configuration.

## Edge cases
The application can be launched by running the `main` function in the `startup.go` file.

## Unclear places
The code does not specify how the configuration files are loaded or how the handlers are registered.

## Dead code
There is no dead code in the provided files.
