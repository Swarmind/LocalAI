External data, input sources:  
- The code defines a PredictionOptions struct which is used to store various options for making predictions. These options can be provided as input to the system.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the provided code.  
  
Summary of major code parts:  
- The PredictionOptions struct contains various fields that can be used to configure the prediction process. These fields include options for specifying the language, whether to translate the input, the number of results to return, and various parameters related to the prediction algorithm.  
  
- The struct also includes fields for custom parameters that are not part of the OpenAI API, such as the batch size, whether to ignore the end-of-sequence token, and penalties for repeating words or phrases.  
  
- The struct also includes fields for parameters related to the AutoGPTQ, Diffusers, and RWKV models, such as the use of a fast tokenizer, the number of layers to skip in the CLIP model, and the type of tokenizer to use.  
  
- The struct is designed to be used in conjunction with the OpenAI API and other machine learning models to generate text, translate languages, and perform other tasks.  
  
- The code does not include any functions or methods for interacting with the API or models, but it provides a structured way to store and manage the necessary options and parameters.  
  
# core/schema/request.go  
Package: schema  
  
Imports:  
- "context"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- The code defines a generic request to LocalAI, which is a system for interacting with local AI models.  
  
TODOs:  
- Should BasicModelRequest include the following fields from the OpenAI side of the world?  
    - Context context.Context  
    - Cancel context.CancelFunc  
    - If so, changes should be made to core/http/middleware/request.go to match  
  
Summary:  
- The code defines a generic request to LocalAI, which is a system for interacting with local AI models.  
- The LocalAIRequest interface is used to represent any request to LocalAI.  
- The BasicModelRequest struct is a concrete implementation of the LocalAIRequest interface.  
- The ModelName method of the BasicModelRequest struct returns the model name.  
  
  
  
# core/schema/tokenize.go  
Package: schema  
  
Imports:  
- json  
  
External data, input sources:  
- Content string in TokenizeRequest  
  
TODOs:  
- None  
  
Summary:  
- The schema package defines the data structures for tokenization requests and responses.  
- TokenizeRequest contains the content to be tokenized and inherits from BasicModelRequest.  
- TokenizeResponse contains the list of tokens generated from the input content.

External data, input sources:

TODOs:  
- None  
  
Summary:  
The schema package defines two structs: TranscriptionSegment and TranscriptionResult. TranscriptionSegment represents a segment of transcribed audio, containing its ID, start and end times, text, and a list of token IDs. TranscriptionResult contains a list of TranscriptionSegments and the full transcribed text. These structs are likely used for storing and exchanging transcription data in a JSON format.
