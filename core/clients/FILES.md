External data, input sources:  
- The code interacts with a store API, which is assumed to be an external service.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the code.  
  
Summary:  
- The code defines a StoreClient struct that interacts with a store API.  
- The StoreClient struct has methods for setting, getting, deleting, and finding data in the store.  
- The Set method takes a SetRequest struct as input and sends a POST request to the "stores/set" endpoint of the store API.  
- The Get method takes a GetRequest struct as input and sends a POST request to the "stores/get" endpoint of the store API. It then parses the response and returns a GetResponse struct.  
- The Delete method takes a DeleteRequest struct as input and sends a POST request to the "stores/delete" endpoint of the store API.  
- The Find method takes a FindRequest struct as input and sends a POST request to the "stores/find" endpoint of the store API. It then parses the response and returns a FindResponse struct.  
- The doRequest and doRequestWithResponse helper functions are used to perform requests to the store API.  
  
- The code defines several structs to represent the data exchanged with the store API. These include SetRequest, GetRequest, GetResponse, DeleteRequest, FindRequest, and FindResponse.  
- The SetRequest struct contains the keys and values to be set in the store.  
- The GetRequest struct contains the keys to be retrieved from the store.  
- The GetResponse struct contains the keys and values retrieved from the store.  
- The DeleteRequest struct contains the keys to be deleted from the store.  
- The FindRequest struct contains the topk and key to be used in the search.  
- The FindResponse struct contains the keys, values, and similarities found in the search.  
  
- The code uses the encoding/json package to marshal and unmarshal JSON data.  
- The net/http package is used to make HTTP requests to the store API.  
- The io package is used to read the response body from the store API.  
- The bytes package is used to create a buffer for the JSON data.  
- The fmt package is used for error handling.
