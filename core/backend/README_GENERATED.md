# LocalAI

This package provides a suite of tools for working with large language models (LLMs) and their outputs. It includes functions for tokenizing text, generating sound, and reranking results.

## Code Summary

The package contains a single test suite for the backend. The test suite is executed using the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library. The test suite is registered with the FailHandler to handle any test failures.

The package also includes functions for working with LLMs and their outputs. These functions include:

- Tokenizing text: The `tokenize` function takes a string of text as input and returns a list of tokens.
- Generating sound: The `soundgeneration` function takes a string of text as input and returns a sound file.
- Reranking results: The `rerank` function takes a list of results and returns a reranked list.

## Relations Between Code Entities

The `llm_test.go` file contains a suite of tests for the `Finetune` function, which is responsible for post-processing the output of a Large Language Model (LLM). The tests cover various scenarios, including when echo is enabled or disabled, when cutstrings regex is applied, when extract regex is applied, when trimming spaces, and when trimming suffixes.

The `backend_suite_test.go` file contains a single test suite for the backend. The test suite is executed using the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library. The test suite is registered with the FailHandler to handle any test failures.
