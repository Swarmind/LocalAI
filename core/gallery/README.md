## Code summary

The gallery_test package contains test suites for the Gallery component. The test suites are written using the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library. The tests are executed by running the TestGallery function, which registers a fail handler and runs the test suite. Before the test suite is executed, the code checks if the FIXTURES environment variable is set. If it is not set, the test suite fails.

The models_test.go file contains tests for the gallery package, which is responsible for managing and installing models from a gallery. The suite includes tests for downloading, installing, and renaming models, as well as handling path traversals. The tests use the gallery package's functions to interact with the gallery and verify the expected behavior. The suite also tests the ability to override model parameters during installation. The tests cover various scenarios, such as installing models from a local file or a URL, and handling errors during installation.

The request_test.go file contains tests for the Gallery API. It tests the ability of the API to parse a GitHub URL with a branch and retrieve the corresponding gallery configuration. The test case uses a sample URL pointing to a GPT-4All-J model configuration file. The API successfully retrieves the configuration and extracts the model name, which is then verified against the expected value.

## Configuration

The code relies on the FIXTURES environment variable to be set.

## Edge cases

The test suites can be launched by running the TestGallery function.
